# Statistic-Calculator-with-GUI
In the Java project, we implemented a s tatistic calculator (roughness analysis tool ) with user friendly interface by JavaFX.

The project supports:  
>- Streaming from text file  
>- Calculate the mean, variance, median and standard deviation  
>- Plot the normalized histogram of the deviation, with an option to choose different bin method  
>- Fit and plot the histogram with a Probability Density Function model (PDF)  
>- Display the fitting parameters  
>- Save the histogram and the fitted PDF as a Bitmap png file  

Note: The project passes test under Java SE Development Kit 8 and requires JFreeChart version 1.5.0.
